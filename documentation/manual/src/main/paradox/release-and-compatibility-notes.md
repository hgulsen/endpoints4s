# Release and Compatibility Notes

## Binary Compatibility and Versioning

We follow the [recommended versioning scheme](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/binary-compatibility-for-library-authors.html#recommended-versioning-scheme)
for Scala projects:

- all the releases with the same *major* version number are backward
  binary compatible,
- all the releases with the same *major* and *minor* version numbers are
  backward source compatible.

The algebra modules and interpreter modules may not follow the same
release lifecycles and may have different version numbers.

You can find the latest version of each module on
[scaladex](https://index.scala-lang.org/endpoints4s/endpoints4s).
